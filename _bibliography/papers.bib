  abstract={Existing end-to-end depth representation in embodied AI is often task-specific and lacks the benefits of emerging pre-training paradigm due to limited datasets and training techniques for RGB-D videos. To address the challenge of obtaining robust and generalized depth representation for embodied AI, we introduce a unified RGB-D video dataset (UniRGBD) and a novel time-aware contrastive (TAC) pre-training approach. UniRGBD addresses the scarcity of large-scale depth pre-training datasets by providing a comprehensive collection of data from diverse sources in a unified format, enabling convenient data loading and accommodating various data domains. We also design an RGB-Depth alignment evaluation procedure and introduce a novel Near-K accuracy metric to assess the scene understanding capability of the depth encoder. Then, the TAC pre-training approach fills the gap in depth pre-training methods suitable for RGB-D videos by leveraging the intrinsic similarity between temporally proximate frames. TAC incorporates a soft label design that acts as valid label noise, enhancing the depth semantic extraction and promoting diverse and generalized knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, the adjustments in perspective between temporally proximate frames facilitate the extraction of invariant and comprehensive features, enhancing the robustness of the learned depth representation. Additionally, the inclusion of temporal information stabilizes training gradients and enables spatio-temporal depth perception. Comprehensive evaluation of RGB-Depth alignment demonstrates the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct uncertainty analysis and a novel zero-shot experiment to validate the robustness and generalization of the TAC approach. Moreover, our TAC pre-training demonstrates significant performance improvements in various embodied AI tasks, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy across diverse domains.},

abstract={Developing agents to follow language instructions is a compelling yet challenging research topic. Recently, vision-and-language navigation in continuous environments has been proposed to explore the multi-modal pattern analysis and mapless navigation abilities of intelligent agents. However, current waypoint-based methods still have shortcomings, such as the coupled decision process and the possible shortest path-instruction misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose an instruction-aligned hierarchical waypoint planner (IA-HWP) that ensures fine-grained waypoint prediction and enhances instruction alignment. Our HWP architecture decouples waypoint planning into a coarse view selection phase and a refined waypoint location phase, effectively improving waypoint quality and enabling specialized training supervision for different phases. In terms of instruction-aligned model design, we introduce the global action-vision co-grounding and local text-vision co-grounding modules to explicitly improve the understanding of visual landmarks and actions, thereby enhancing the alignment between instructions and trajectories. In terms of instruction-aligned model optimization, we employ reference-waypoint-oriented supervision and direction-aware loss to optimize the model for enhanced instruction following and waypoint execution capabilities. Experiments on the standard benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with improved success rate compared to existing methods.},

  abstract={Can multimodal encoder evolve when facing increasingly tough circumstances? Our work investigates this possibility in the context of continuous vision-language navigation (continuous VLN), which aims to navigate robots under linguistic supervision and visual feedback. We propose a multimodal evolutionary encoder (MEE) comprising a unified multimodal encoder architecture and an evolutionary pre-training strategy. The unified multimodal encoder unifies rich modalities, including depth and sub-instruction, to enhance the solid understanding of environments and tasks. It also effectively utilizes monocular observation, reducing the reliance on panoramic vision. The evolutionary pre-training strategy exposes the encoder to increasingly unfamiliar data domains and difficult objectives. The multi-stage adaption helps the encoder establish robust intra- and inter-modality connections and improve its generalization to unfamiliar environments. To achieve such evolution, we collect a large-scale multi-stage dataset with specialized objectives, addressing the absence of suitable continuous VLN pre-training. Evaluation on VLN-CE demonstrates the superiority of MEE over other direct action-predicting methods. Furthermore, we deploy MEE in real scenes using self-developed service robots, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/RavenKiller/MEE.},
